Thai language utility for Ruby

I have built this project in order to collect and share tools for Thai language, which are written in Ruby language. 

# chlevel is similar th_chlevel in [libthai](http://linux.thai.net/projects/libthai).
# string_chlevel gives array of level back for example string_chlevel("กี") will return [1, 2]
